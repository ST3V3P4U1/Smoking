<h2>Smoking</h2>
<img id="introimg" src="smokingbad.jpg">
<p>Millions of people around the world smoke. Tobacco smoke or any other substance is inhaled and exhaled. Smoking is highly addictive and extremely harmful to one's health. Cancer, heart disease, and stroke are among the diseases it increases.</p>
<br>
  <p>In recent decades, smoking has become a significant public health concern as its prevalence has increased. Every year, it causes many premature deaths. Additionally, it has a significant economic impact due to higher healthcare costs. Non-smokers can also be affected by social stigma and second-hand smoke.</p>
<br>  
  <P>There is a serious problem with smoking. Governments have implemented various measures to discourage smoking, such as taxation, advertising bans, and public awareness campaigns. However, more must be done to decrease its prevalence and protect people from its harmful effects.</p>

            <p>One of the main effects of smoking is lung cancer. This is because smoking damages the lungs and can cause cancer. In addition to lung cancer, smoking can also lead to other types of cancer, such as throat, mouth, and bladder cancer.

            Another effect of smoking is that it can lead to respiratory problems. Smoking can cause chronic bronchitis, which is a condition where the airways become inflamed and narrowed. This can make it difficult to breathe and can lead to coughing and wheezing. Smoking can also cause emphysema, which is a condition where the air sacs in the lungs become damaged. This can lead to shortness of breath and can make it difficult to do everyday activities.
        
            Finally, smoking can also have a negative impact on a person's cardiovascular health. Smoking can cause the arteries to become narrow, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. Smoking can also increase a person's blood pressure and can cause the heart to work harder than it should. This can lead to a variety of cardiovascular problems, including heart attacks and heart failure.</p>

              4. Avoid triggers: Identify the people, places, and situations that make you want to smoke and try to avoid them. This may mean avoiding certain social situations or finding new ways to cope with stress.
              
              5. Stay positive: Remember that quitting smoking is a process and it may take several attempts before you are successful. Stay positive and don't give up. The benefits of quitting smoking are well worth it.
              
              In conclusion, quitting smoking is a challenging but achievable goal. With the right mindset and support, you can successfully quit smoking and improve your overall health and wellbeing.</p>
